# Development
Duplicate `.env.sample` and rename as `.env` and replace values with the corresponding environment variables.

## Scraping
Depending on where you are going to run the scrapers, set the `RUN_PUPPETEER` env variable correspondingly.
If you are running locally for the first time, `npm i puppeteer` so that it downloads the automated browser.
